# Personal website

This is the source code of my personal website.
It is written entirely in Uiua, using a server,
attribute based routing and html templating via
[Hypertext.ua](https://github.com/donstenzel/hypertext.ua).

For the styling I use [Cirrus UI](https://cirrus-ui.com/),
which offers pre-defined classes.

Maybe later: [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
